## Writing Projects

### GOVT 391: GIS For Social Science
My term project for this course involved an analysis of the impact of sea level rise on public housing developments in New York City. I created a series of maps using ArcGIS Pro, with data from the city of New York. The project is viewable [here](https://caroline-mccain.github.io/Writing/NYCHA_Housing_Developments.pdf).

### Internship with City Manager's Office in Lexington, VA  
In 2019, I completed a summer internship with my local City Manager's Office. The primary goal of the internship was to create the FY19 Annual Report, a document for public consumption that highlighted the previous fiscal year's accomplishments. A copy of the report is viewable [here](https://caroline-mccain.github.io/Writing/FY19_Annual_Report.pdf).
