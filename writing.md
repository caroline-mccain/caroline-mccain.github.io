## Writing Projects

### GOVT 391: GIS For Social Science
My term project four this course involved an analysis of the impact of sea level rise on public housing developments in New York City. I created a series of maps using ArcGIS Pro, with data from the city of New York. The project is viewable [here](https://caroline-mccain.github.io/Writing/NYCHA_Housing_Developments.pdf).
