## Bio
Originally from Lexington, Virginia, I am a current sophomore at William & Mary. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Government. I have a passion for using my skills to  help those around me. I love computer science because I enjoy solving tough problems. I've been in love with coding ever since I felt the satisfaction of writing my first "Hello World!" I think that government is fascinating in the way that it shapes our lives. I am particularly interested in American politics. I aspire to attend law school and earn a Master's in Urban Planning.
